Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: When you initialize a repo, it creates a MAIN branch and a hidden file ".git" which
tracks all the activity and meta data within that repo.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers to developers?
A: Staging area allows to you to collect files prior to committing them to the repo. This
allows us to verify what files are being added/committed prior to making the commit.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: You can do a git diff --staged which will tell you the differences between the last 
commit and the the staged version.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?
A: Branches are helpful when we need to try out new features but want to keep the main 
body of work (i.e. Master) intact. Branches are also helpful when we want to create a
version of app in another language (say Italian).
