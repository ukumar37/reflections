Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: When you initialize a repo, it creates a MAIN branch and a hidden file ".git" which
tracks all the activity and meta data within that repo.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?
A: Staging area allows to you to collect files prior to committing them to the repo. This
allows us to verify what files are being added/committed prior to making the commit.
