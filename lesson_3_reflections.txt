Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rathern than keeping all your work
local?
A: I would creare a remote repo when I want to share my work with other users (private or 
public).

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Manual git pulls ensure that you determine when exactly code should be pulled from the 
remote. If you have a public repo you are pulling from, manual git pull will allow you to 
pick/choose the changes you want to pull down.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
A: Forks are used to clone a github repo into your account (to another repo on github). 
Clones are used to copy a github repo onto your local machine. Branches are used to do
bug fixes or add/test new features in a safe way prior to merging them into the Master.
